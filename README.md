# CSV Password Cleaner üöÄ

License: MIT

## Overview

PWCLNR is a robust Python CSV Password Cleaner application to consolidates CSV passwords exports from various password managers to migrate into a single new password manager, without duplicates entries. It removes duplicates and normalizes URLs, proven to work efficiently on files with up to 30,000 lines. Running locally ensures privacy while handling critical personal information.

## Features

- **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminates exact duplicate rows based on URL, username, and password.
- **Domain Handling:** Identifies and removes duplicates on a domain basis.
- **URL Standardization:** Cleans URLs by stripping prefixes like 'www.', 'http://', and 'https://'.
- **Logging:** Generates a detailed log of the cleaning process including counts of removed duplicates and URL occurrences.
- **Output Generation:** Produces two output files:
  - `cleaned_file.csv`: The cleaned CSV file.
  - `removed_rows.csv`: The log CSV file detailing rows removed during processing.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built using tkinter for easy file selection and operation.
- **CLI Entry-Point:** The application launches via `main.py` which starts the GUI.
